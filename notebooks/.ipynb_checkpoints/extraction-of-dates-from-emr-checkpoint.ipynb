    "# Extraction of dates from EHR\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be working with messy medical data and using regex to extract relevant infromation from the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each line of the `dates.txt` file corresponds to a medical note. Each note has a date that needs to be extracted, but each date is encoded in one of many formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to correctly identify all of the different date variants encoded in this dataset and to properly normalize and sort the dates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of some of the variants you might encounter in this dataset:\n",
    "* 04/20/2009; 04/20/09; 4/20/09; 4/3/09\n",
    "* Mar-20-2009; Mar 20, 2009; March 20, 2009;  Mar. 20, 2009; Mar 20 2009;\n",
    "* 20 Mar 2009; 20 March 2009; 20 Mar. 2009; 20 March, 2009\n",
    "* Mar 20th, 2009; Mar 21st, 2009; Mar 22nd, 2009\n",
    "* Feb 2009; Sep 2009; Oct 2010\n",
    "* 6/2008; 12/2009\n",
    "* 2009; 2010\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have extracted these date patterns from the text, the next step is to sort them in ascending chronological order accoring to the following rules:\n",
    "* Assume all dates in xx/xx/xx format are mm/dd/yy\n",
    "* Assume all dates where year is encoded in only two digits are years from the 1900's (e.g. 1/5/89 is January 5th, 1989)\n",
    "* If the day is missing (e.g. 9/2009), assume it is the first day of the month (e.g. September 1, 2009).\n",
    "* If the month is missing (e.g. 2010), assume it is the first of January of that year (e.g. January 1, 2010).\n",
    "* Watch out for potential typos as this is a raw, real-life derived dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these rules in mind, find the correct date in each note and return a pandas Series in chronological order of the original Series' indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if the original series was this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    0    1999\n",
    "    1    2010\n",
    "    2    1978\n",
    "    3    2015\n",
    "    4    1985\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should return this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    0    2\n",
    "    1    4\n",
    "    2    0\n",
    "    3    1\n",
    "    4    3\n",
    "\n",
    "Your score will be calculated using [Kendall's tau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient), a correlation measure for ordinal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*This function should return a Series of length 500 and dtype int.*"

Important psychological factors include the loss of three improtant family members and the prior trauma at multiple times.

       "107  Pt is a 21 year old, single, heterosexual identified, Liechtenstein male. He resides in Rabat, in a rented apartment, with a roommate. He has not graduated from high school nor has he earned his GED. He has been working full time, steadily, since the age of 16. He recently left a job at jacobs engineering group where he worked for about 5 years. He started working at becton dickinson a few weeks ago. Referral to SMH was precipitated by pt seeing his PCP, Dr. Ford, for a physical and sharing concerns re: depression. He was having suicidal thoughts the week of 8/22/83 and noticed that his depression and anxiety symptoms were starting to interfere with work. Per Dr. Ford's recommendation, he contacted PAL for assistance. When screened for substance use, pt was referred to SMH for an intake. Pt was scheduled to be seen last week due to urgency of his depression and SI, but missed the intake appointment due to getting extremely intoxicated the night before. Pt presents today seeking individual therapy and psychiatry services to address longstanding depression.\\n   \n",
       "108  PET Scan (DPSH 5/04/74): 1) Marked hypometabolism involving the bilateral caudate nuclei. This is a non-specific finding, although this raises the question of a multisystem atrophy, specifically MSA-P (striatonigral degeneration), 2) Cortical hypometabolism involving the right inferior frontal gyrus. This is a non-specific finding of uncertain significance, and is not definitively related to a neurodegenerative process, although pathology in this region is not excluded\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "231  50 yo DWF with a history of alcohol use disorder, anxiety and depression, and prior trauma history, no prior psychiatric treatment referred for care at ZMH by PCP.  She is seeking help mainly around management of anxiety, and it is unclear to what extent alcohol (which she has not consumed since May 2016) is affecting her current situation.  Biological factors include likely primary mood and/or anxiety disorders (perhaps depression with panic attacks), consequences of long-term alcohol use. Important psychological factors include the loss of three improtant family members and the prior trauma at multiple times.

Her auditory hallucinations consist of her father's voicing telling her to come with him, but she denies any commands to harm herself. Father died Oct 1986, mother died the year prior.

       "312  .On review of systems, she reports that her sleep is generally good, except when she wakes up around 1am and struggles to fall back asleep for an hour or more.  On these instances she usually wakes up exhausted.  She reports going to sleep around 8:30 or 9pm because her partner keeps an early schedule (wakes up at 4am), though she says she typically sleeps much later because she does not have to be at work until 10 am.  She reports enjoying activities, eating well, and having good energy and ability to concentrate.  She denies suicidal thoughts or self-injury since February 1989  (her last suicide attempt).  She denies thoughts of harming others or access to guns.  She denies current or prior symptoms of mania or psychosis.  She endorses drinking two glasses of wine per night, though on rare occasions she drinks three (usually when she \"overreacts\").  She states this has happened about 5 times in the past few months.  She denies feeling shaky in the morning and denies other substance use or cigarette smoking.\\n                                                  \n",

       "394  .  Pt described period of difficulty that started 10/2001 with lack of work as an copyeditor and a break up w a BF that spiraled into her dc of medications and decompensation of mental state, requiring extensive inpatient and residential care.  She feels she has recovered from that mental health relapse and is healthier at this time, putting greater focus on her overall health and well being, having positive supports and being honest w them about her functioning, and feeling a strong connection w her psychiatrist.

He is not sure how long he was out for but the next thing he remembers he was in the ambulance going to the hospital. He reports problems since that time although it was hard to get a sense of the specific symptoms he is experiencing. He reports he tends to wake up in the middle of the night and feels like he is having a seizure and can't control his body. He will feel disoriented at times (not completely dissociative, but feels \"weird, out of my body.\" He also had headaches and feels lightheaded. He reports he has also been struggling with depression since the incident where he will have good days and down days. On the down days, he wants to sleep all day and not get out of bed.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
